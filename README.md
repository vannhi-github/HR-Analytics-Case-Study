## Overview
A company called XYZ, at any given time, employs about 4,000 people. However, every year, about 15% of a company's employees leave the company and need to be replaced by available talent in the job market. Management believes that this level of attrition (employees leaving voluntarily or due to layoffs) is bad for the company for the following reasons: 

  • Projects of former employees are behind schedule, difficult to meet schedules, causing loss of reputation with consumers and partners. 

  • Need to maintain a large department for the purpose of recruiting new talent 

  • Usually, new employees must be trained on the job and/or have time to get acquainted with the company.
